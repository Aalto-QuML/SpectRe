This is the official repo for the paper [Graph persistence goes spectral](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=wU8IKGLpbi) (NeurIPS 2025).


## Installing routines to compute SpectRe (FastSpectre) diagrams
This repo is highly based on https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/RePHINE. Please, see the base repo for installing basic dependencies. 

```
cd torch_ph
python setup_spectre.py install 
python setup_spectre_scheduling.py install
```

## Experiments on expressivity

To reproduce the experiments on Cayley graphs, e.g., cayley-24, you must first run 
```
python datasets/create_cayley_data.py --dataset minCayleyGraphs24Vertices
```

Then, see the python notebook ```Experiments - Cayley.ipynb``` to obtain the results.

For BREC datasets, run the python notebook ```Experiments - BREC.ipynb```. 


## Experiments using real data

For the main experiments, we run the ```main.py``` with the arguments in ```cli_main.py```. For instance, to run FastSpectre on NCI109 combined with a GCN model, we run:
```
python main.py --dataset NCI109  --diagram_type fast_spectre --gnn gcn --max_epochs 200 --out_dim_eigen_deep_set 32 --num_filtrations 2  
```
